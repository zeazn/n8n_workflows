# My N8n Workflows

A collection of N8n workflows I've built to automate various tasks. These are real workflows I use personally, shared here in case they're useful to others.

## üöÄ What's Here

Personal automation workflows for:
- **Document Processing** - PDF data extraction and organization
- **File Management** - Automated file sorting and backups
- **Data Integration** - Connecting different apps and services
- **Notifications** - Automated alerts and messaging
- **WIP** - Works in progress

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

1. **Browse the workflows** - Each folder has its own README with setup instructions
2. **Import to N8n** - Copy the JSON and import into your N8n instance
3. **Update the placeholders** - Replace template values with your actual IDs/keys
4. **Test before using** - Always test workflows before putting them into production

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Security**: All sensitive data has been removed - you'll need to add your own API keys and IDs
- **Testing**: These work for me, but test them in your environment first
- **Support**: I'm learning too, so I can't provide extensive support, but feel free to open issues

## ü§ù Contributing

If you improve a workflow or find bugs, pull requests are welcome! Just make sure to:
- Remove any sensitive data

## üìÑ License

Feel free to use these workflows however you want. No warranty provided - use at your own risk.
